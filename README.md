# stockPrediction
Here's a Jupyter notebook code that demonstrates how to use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock prices. I'll use a generic structure for this, and you can replace the stock data with any company stock you'd like to analyze

Explanation:
Loading Data: Replace your_stock_data.csv with the path to the CSV file containing stock data. The CSV should have at least a Close column.
Preprocessing: Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale values between 0 and 1, making it easier for the LSTM model to process.
Time Series Data: We create sequences of 60-day closing prices to predict the next dayâ€™s price.
Model Construction: The LSTM model is built using Sequential, containing two LSTM layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.
Training: The model is trained on 80% of the data for 20 epochs with a batch size of 64.
Prediction: The model predicts the stock prices for the test dataset, and the results are plotted.<
